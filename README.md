# Figure Generation Code

This repository contains the code used to generate the figures in the manuscript  
**“Kinetic energy in random recurrent neural networks.”**

- Each `FigX/` folder contains the scripts for generating the corresponding figure.
- `Gen_Datas_Fig2Fig3.py` generates the data used to plot **Figure 2** and **Figure 3**.
- Data generation for the other figures is included in their corresponding `FigX/` folders.
